- "Today's programming wisdom is to focus on writing clean, maintainable code that is easy to understand and test. This means using clear and descriptive variable names, breaking complex tasks into smaller functions, and commenting your code thoroughly. Remember, code is read more often than it is written, so make sure it's easy for others (and your future self) to read and understand."
